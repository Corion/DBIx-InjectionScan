# NAME

DBIx::InjectionScan - detect when an SQL injection scan fails

# SYNOPSIS

    my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:SQLite:dbname=:memory:', undef, undef, {
        HandleError => \&detect_injection_scan,
        #RaiseError => 1,
        PrintError => 0,
    });

    my $scan_detected = DBIx::InjectionScan->wrap(
        dbh => $dbh,
        on_detection => sub( $dbh, $statement, $file, $package, $line ) {
            warn "Possible SQL injection hole in <<$statement>> called from $location";
            # mail this information to your security team
        },
    );

# METHODS

This is a detector for failed attempts of SQL injections. Alerts raised by this
detector are most likely caused by exploitable use of strings to build SQL
statements.
